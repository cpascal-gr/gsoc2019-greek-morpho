## Morphological dictionary

An SQLite3 database containing the following data.

About 91200 lemmas with about 900000 surface forms with morphological information
, 518000 of which are distinct. The Morphological tags are based on Universal Dependencies.
Unfortunately about 35000 of the lemmas are incomplete, meaning the database doesn't contain
their inflected forms, because there is no inflection table in el.wiktionary.org.
This is an area for future improvement.

Apart from the morphological dictionary, the database also contains
1. Definitions
2. Etymologies
2. Synonyms
3. Antonyms
4. Normalized forms (επτά-εφτά)
5. Translations
